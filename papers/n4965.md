## Acknowledgements

Thanks to all those who have
[submitted editorial issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and to those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New papers

 * [N4964](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4964.pdf) is the
   current working draft for C++26. It replaces
   [N4958](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4958.pdf).
 * N4965 is this Editors' Report.

## Comments on the Draft International Standard

This report includes a snapshot of our dispositions on the Draft International Standard (DIS)
ballot comments for C++23 from national bodies and the ISO secretariat. Some of them only apply
to the published standard document and not the working draft, and the corresponding edits do not
appear in the working draft commit history. All comments on the ballot were editorial.

* **ISO/CS 01:** Accepted. We added references to the tables.
* **ISO/CS 02:** _in progress_
* **ISO/CS 03:** Accepted. We are now referring to a specific element, and keeping the dated reference.
* **ISO/CS 04:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 05:** Rejected: We do not understand the justification "Since there is no specific element referenced this reference shall be undated." The Drafting Directives seem to make a clear case for when undated (10.4) and dated (10.5) references are appropriate, and we firmly fall into the case where an undated reference is inappropriate ("if it will be possible to use all future changes of the referenced document" is defintely not the case). Reference to a specific element does not seem to be required in order to permit the use of a dated reference. Even the House Style seems to permit dated references when necessary: "When referring to the whole document, use an undated document number unless it is necessary that the user refers to a specific edition".
* **ISO/CS 06:** Rejected: Moot by comment 05.
* **ISO/CS 07:** Rejected: Moot by comment 05.
* **ISO/CS 08:** Accepted. We reworded the reference to the Unicode standard to make the normative nature more obvious.
* **ISO/CS 09:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 10:** Rejected: We find domains valuable here, since the terms often sound like plain English words, but have rather domain-specific meaning, and the domain establishes important context to aid understandability.
* **ISO/CS 11:** Accepted with modifications: four unused definitions are removed. The remaining term, "unspecified behavior" is retained, since it captures a variety of patterns which are not lexically spelled "behavior" but are neatly covered by this umbrella term.
* **ISO/CS 12:** Accepted with modifications: we have italicized the cross-references. However, for the formal grammar terms that we display in italic sans font, please see the discussion on comment 32.
* **ISO/CS 13:** Rejected: The token "CE" is not an acronym, but a meta variable (like "x" or "y". It is typeset distinctly. The name is evocative of its use.
* **ISO/CS 14:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 15:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 16:** Rejected: The wording is correct as written. However, this is also mooted by comment 11, which deletes the wording in question.
* **ISO/CS 17:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 18:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 19:** Accepted.
* **CA 20:** n/a, comment was filed erroneously
* **JP 21:** Accepted. We added an example.
* **JP 22:** Rejected: No consensus for change; any attributes of a lambda-declarator are considered to be attached to the synthesized function call operator or operator template (i.e. the member function of the closure type), not the closure type itself.
* **JP 23:** Accepted with modifications: The example is written as intended. The comments in the example have been amended to clarify the exposition.
* **JP 24:** Accepted.
* **JP 25:** Accepted.
* **JP 26:** Rejected: No concensus for change; the example deliberately introduces a facility to aid comprehension.
* **JP 27:** Rejected: No concensus for change; the example deliberately introduces a facility to aid comprehension.
* **JP 28:** Rejected: No concensus for change; the example deliberately introduces a facility to aid comprehension.
* **ISO/CS 29:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 30:** Accepted. We added a note that refers to the annex.
* **ISO/CS 31:** Accepted. We had previously used foreword wording from an older document.
* **ISO/CS 32:** Rejected (to be discussed), along with comment 12.
* **ISO/CS 33:** Rejected: We have an approved SC22 ballot to permit the use of paragraph numbers. (We also have a proposal for the JDMT to add such a permission to the Drafting Directives.)
* **ISO/CS 34:** Accepted. Reworded to clarify.
* **ISO/CS 35:** Accepted.
* **ISO/CS 36:** Accepted the notes and tables captioning changes. Rejected the UK English spelling: The document defines many terms that must be spelled the same way by conforming implementations and by users of those implementations, and these terms use US English spelling. It would be confusing for the document text to use UK English spelling when describing these terms. (This is the same disposition as for a similar comment on the DIS ballot of 14882:2017.)
* **ISO/CS 37:** _in progress_
* **ISO/CS 38:** Accepted with modifications: We will review the presentation of cross-references in Clause 3. However, the use of italics in Clause 3 is not a regular "emphasis/definition" in body font, but rather a grammar production, which we typeset distinctly. Please also see the discussion regarding comment 32.
* **ISO/CS 39:** _in progress_
* **ISO/CS 40:** Accepted. The logic that processed the notes was erroneous and failed to handle subclauses with more than 9 notes; this has been fixed.

## Editorial changes

There have not been any motions from WG21 since the last working draft. This
revision incorporates all the changes resulting from the DIS ballot comments for
C++23, in as far as they apply to the current working draft, as well as other
editorial changes.

### Minor editorial changes

A log of editorial fixes made to the working draft since N4958 is below. This
list excludes changes that do not affect the body text or only affect whitespace
or typeface. For a complete list including such changes (or for the actual
deltas applied by these changes), consult the
[draft sources on GitHub](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/compare/n4958...n4964).

        [algorithms.parallel.defns] New paragraph for example (#6447)

    Date:   Wed Sep 13 00:24:17 2023 -0700

        [mdspan.layout.stride.cons] Fix cross-reference (#6565)

    commit 536653b854e293af569156864ea6aa407c90e011
    Author: Casey Carter <Casey@Carter.net>
    Date:   Mon Sep 11 10:36:39 2023 -0700

        [mdspan.extents.cons] require conversions to index_type to be nonnegative

        "nonnegative" is meaningless for a value of some arbitrary type which we've only required to be convertible to the integral type `index_type`, so this wording clearly intends to constrain the result of the conversion.

    commit 5c7841b1530dc02dbf7feacd5e154b777632dc36
    Author: Casey Carter <Casey@Carter.net>
    Date:   Mon Sep 11 16:56:47 2023 -0700

        [mdspan.layout.stride.cons] Convert to integral type before comparing to 0

        `s[i]` is an lvalue of a type that we can only convert to `index_type`; clearly the wording intends that the result of the conversion should be `> 0`.

    commit 24659bd716808538fb7066103a396e785e4f0099
    Author: Casey Carter <Casey@Carter.net>
    Date:   Mon Sep 11 16:59:56 2023 -0700

        [mdspan.layout.stride.expo] Convert to integral type to perform math

        [mdspan.layout.stride.cons] uses either a span or array of a type which we can only convert to `index_type` as the second argument to the exposition-only `REQUIRED-SPAN-SIZE`. We must perform that conversion before doing math with the result.
